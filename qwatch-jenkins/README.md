# Quality Watch - Jenkins

This module focus on Jenkins build analysis, by extracting data from Maven
Surefire reports and Maven Failsafe reports. The results are exported as CSV
file `executions.csv`.

## Artifact

Artifacts generated by Jenkins should be stored in
`/Users/mincong/jenkins/jenkins-artifacts`. By respecting the naming convention
for each job execution:

    ${jobName}.${id}

where job name (`jobName`) contains lowercase characters (`[a-z]`) and dash
(`-`), and job id (`jobId`) is a positive integer.
