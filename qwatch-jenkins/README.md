# Quality Watch - Jenkins

This module focus on Jenkins build analysis, by extracting data from Maven
Surefire reports and Maven Failsafe reports. The results are exported as CSV
file `executions.csv`.

## Artifact

Artifacts generated by Jenkins should be stored in
`/Users/mincong/jenkins/jenkins-artifacts`. By respecting the naming convention
for each job execution:

    ${jobName}.${id}

where job name (`jobName`) contains lowercase characters (`[a-z]`) and dash
(`-`), and job id (`jobId`) is a positive integer.

## Console Log

Console log needs to be downloaded manually from the web page "Console Output"
of Jenkins job. This can be done by using the following JavaScript in the
browser console. Why we don't use raw console log? Because raw log does not
contain timestamp, which is crucial for build time measurement.

```js
copy($$(".console-output")[0].innerText)
```

Once copied, create a file called `jenkins.log` in the root level of the
artifact directory.

    ${jobName}.${id}/jenkins.log
